This allows you to launch a Jupyter session in the cloud using [BinderHub](https://mybinder.org/). Because Binder first needs to build the appropriate environment (inlcuding all dependencies), it can take a while to launch initially. Computational resources are also limited in the free service and we are not thoroughly maintaining compatability. But perhaps you'll still find this feature useful.\n",
