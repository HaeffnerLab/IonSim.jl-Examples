	journal = {New Journal of Physics},
	abstract = {In ion traps, entangling gate operations can be realized by a bichromatic pair of laser beams that collectively interact with the ions. In this paper, a new method of modelling the laser–ion interaction is introduced that turns out to be superior to standard techniques for the description of gate operations on optical qubits. The treatment allows for a comparison of the performance of gates based on σz⊗σz and σϕ⊗σϕ interactions on optical transitions where the bichromatic laser field can be realized by an amplitude-modulated laser resonant with the qubit transition. Shaping the amplitude of the bichromatic laser pulse is shown to make the gates more robust against experimental imperfections.}
